# ðŸ“–PROBLEM STATEMENT

This project aims to predict the monthly closing prices of Yes Bank Limited's stock. Yes Bank, a key player in India's financial sector, has faced substantial market volatility due to various factors. By analyzing historical stock data and employing predictive modeling techniques, we seek to develop accurate forecasting models. Key tasks include data exploration, feature engineering, model development, and impact analysis. The project's success will provide investors and analysts with valuable insights, enhancing decision-making in the dynamic financial market. Ultimately, this project strives to contribute to a deeper understanding of Yes Bank's stock performance and its underlying drivers.

# ðŸ“–CONCLUSION

â€¢	There is increase in trend of Yes Bank's stock's Close,Open,High,Low price till 2018 an then sudden decrease.

â€¢ We observed that open vs close price graph concluded that after 2018 yes bank's stock hitted drastically.

â€¢ We saw Linear relation between the dependent and independent values.

â€¢ There was alot of multicollinearity present in data.

â€¢ Target variable(dependent variable) strongly dependent on independent variables

â€¢	We get maximum accuracy of 98.6%.

â€¢ Linear regression and Ridge regression get almost same R squared value.

â€¢ Lasso model shows lowest R squared value and high MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE.

â€¢ Ridge regression shrunk the parameters to reduce complexity and multicollinearity but ended up affecting the evaluation metrics.

â€¢ Lasso regression did feature selection and ended up giving up worse results than ridge which again reflects the fact that each feature is important.

â€¢ KNeighborsRegressor end up giving the highest R squared value. The predicted values are nearly equal to the actual values. We got 98.6% accuracy.

â€¢ SVM and Elastic Net showed nearly equal accuracy.
